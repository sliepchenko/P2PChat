# ðŸ¥· **P2PChat**
#### Simple chat based on P2P
The main idea of this project is to create a multiplayer serverless chat.
I wrote a simple wrapper for the PeerJS library to serve all my necessaries for this project.

## How to run
Project wrote as a simple example, JS attached with type="module", so all you need is a launch as it is.

## External Dependencies
